# Astronomical Calculations

The program was developed in Python first, and I first comitted it to this repository.

At 2018.05.04, 11:50 UT, I migrated the files to the https://github.com/masterdesky/ELTE_Kutinfo_gyakorlat_2018 repository and continued to translate the source code to C++. Now it's moved backed into this repository, and will stay here.

## Functionality of the program:

The main goal was, primarily, to create a program, with various functions, which could be helpful at solving simple, yet many astronomical problems. Secondly to implement some informative functionality, like plotting analemma, or calculating time of the sunset at given date and location, etc.

### Currently the following functions are implemented:

1. Conversion of astronomical coordinate systems
2. Calculating geographical distance of given locations on the spherical Earth
3. Calculating Local Mean Sidereal Time (LMST) for given date and location
4. Calculating exact time of sunrise/sunset and twilights for given date and location
5. Solving astronomical (spherical) triangle
6. Drawing a the shadow of the Sun's path on the ground at given date and location
7. Drawing Solar analemma for given date and location
