The program was first developed in python, and I first comitted it to the following repository:
https://github.com/masterdesky/Astro_Calculations_2018

At 2018.05.04, 11:50 UT, I migrated the files into this repository and continued to translate it to C++.

## The program does the following things:
#### It's actually a universal astronomical problem solver program, which calculates and plots a dozen of things
1. Astronomical Coordinate System Conversions
2. Geographical Distance Calculations
3. Local Mean Sidereal Time Calculator
4. Calculate the Time of Different Twilights for given Date and Location
5. Solves Astronomical (Spherical) Triangles
6. Draws a Sundial at given Location for the whole year
